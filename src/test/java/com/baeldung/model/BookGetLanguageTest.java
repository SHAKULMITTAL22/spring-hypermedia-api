================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential private member exposure
Issue: Getter methods can potentially expose sensitive information if not properly managed.
Solution: Ensure that getter methods do not provide access to sensitive or mutable data.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation for the 'getLanguage' method
Issue: The 'getLanguage' method does not validate or sanitize data before returning. This could potentially lead to data leaks or allow untrusted data to propagate through the system, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Consider adding input validation or sanitization before returning data from methods.

"""
 Scenario 1: Validating correct language retrieval 

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidLanguageRetrieval
    Description: This test scenario is meant to verify that the getLanguage method correctly returns the language string as expected. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the getLanguage method is defined, and set the language string.
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method.
    Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the returned language string is the same as the string previously set. The expected result is correct if it matches the set string. This test is necessary to ensure that the getLanguage method is working correctly.


 Scenario 2: Test getLanguage method when no language is set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetLanguageWithoutSettingLanguage
    Description: This test scenario is meant to verify the behavior of the getLanguage method when no language string has been set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the getLanguage method is defined, but do not set the language string.
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method.
    Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the returned string value when no language is set. The expected result is null, as nothing was set. Tests like this are necessary to ensure that even edge cases, like when the variable is not initialized, the method behaves as expected.


 Scenario 3: Test getLanguage method when empty language string is set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetLanguageWithEmptyString
    Description: This test scenario is meant to verify the behavior of the getLanguage method when an empty string is given as the language. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the getLanguage method is defined, then set the language string as "" (empty).
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method.
    Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the returned string is empty as that is what was set. The expected result is an empty string, as that is what we set. Tests like this are necessary to ensure that even when the input string is empty, the method behaves as expected.
