================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information (Privacy Violation)
Issue: If the ID is sensitive information (like user ID), exposing getter method could give potential attackers the chance to access this info.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information wherever possible. If it is required, make sure to secure the access, for example with appropriate authentication and authorization checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation
Issue: The method does not perform any validation. If this ID is used in your application in a way that should be restricted, this could allow unauthorized access.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Implement proper access control measures.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: If this ID allows access to critical resource, it's a potential risk area.
Solution: Ensure secure default permissions. Validate access both when accessing the ID and the resource itself.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate getId returns the expected value

  Details:
    TestName: validateGetIdReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test will validate that the getId method returns the expected value within the current instance of the class. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with a known id value.
    Act: Invoke getId method on the instantiated class.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the initial id value that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify the functionality of the getId method. The expected result is correct retrieval of id value. This test scenario is significant in validating that the getId method works as expected, and it always returns the correct instance id value.

Scenario 2: Validate getId returns null for unset id

  Details:
    TestName: validateGetIdReturnsNull
    Description: This test is to check whether getId method returns null when id isn't initialized or set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class without setting the id value.
    Act: Call getId method on the instantiated class.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion is verifying that getId method returns null when id isn't initialized. This test scenario is significant because it validates the correct function of the getId method, even when there is no id set.

Scenario 3: Validate getId type consistency

  Details:
    TestName: validateGetTypeConsistencyOfGetId
    Description: Test will ensure that getId always returns type Long even when id is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the class is created and initialized with id value set and unset.
    Act: Call getId on the instantiated class.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is always of type Long.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify that getId always returns values of type Long regardless of whether id is set or not. This is important to enforce method's return type consistency across all possible invocation scenarios.
