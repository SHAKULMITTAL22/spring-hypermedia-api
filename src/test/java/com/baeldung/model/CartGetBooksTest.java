ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getBooks_7326b6767f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getBooks_9722ce6c80

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The method getBooks() is returning a reference to its private mutable object 'books'. This breaks the encapsulation. Malicious code may modify the list of books.
Solution: Return a new object or an unmodifiable view of the object. In this case, you can return a copy of 'books'. This can be implemented using 'return new ArrayList<>(books);'

Vulnerability: Incorrect Import (CWE-940)
Issue: The import statement 'import java.util.ArrayList;' is incorrect as there is a ';' in the line making it invalid syntax in java.
Solution: Correct the import statement by removing ';' before comma. For instance, 'import java.util.ArrayList, java.util.List;'

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate getBooks() Method Successful Retrieval of Book List
  Details:
    TestName: testGetBooksSuccessful
    Description: This test ensures that all the books can be retrieved successfully by the getBooks() method.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: A list of books is initialized with few entries.
    Act: The getBooks() method is invoked. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list matches the initial list.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getBooks method successfully fetches all the books. The expected result is the initial list because no modifications are made during the operation. This test confirms the retrieval functionality of the getBooks method.

Scenario 2: Test Empty Book List Retrieval
  Details:
    TestName: testGetBooksEmptyList
    Description: This test checks if the getBooks() method can handle and return an empty list of books as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An empty list of books is initialized.
    Act: The getBooks() method is invoked.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned book list is indeed empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getBooks method can handle the case of no existing books and returns an empty list. This test checks the functionality of the getBooks method in edge case scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test Null Book List Retrieval
  Details:
    TestName: testGetBooksNull
    Description: This test verifies if the getBooks() method can handle a null scenario, this could be due to uninitialized book list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No initialization of the book list is done, kept as null.
    Act: The getBooks() method is invoked.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if the returned book list is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getBooks method can handle the case of a null book list. This test illustrates the robustness of the getBooks method's error handling ability.

Scenario 4: Test Book List Retrieval of Single Book
  Details:
    TestName: testGetOneBook
    Description: This test checks if the getBooks() method can accurately retrieve a list with a single book.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A list of books is initialized with a single book.
    Act: The getBooks() method is invoked.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list matches the initial list.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getBooks method can handle the scenario with a single book. The test assesses the functionality of the getBooks method in this edge case scenario.
