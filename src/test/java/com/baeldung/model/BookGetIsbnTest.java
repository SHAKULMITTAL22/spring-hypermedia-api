================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Entity Beans ({CWE-200})
Issue: In Java Persistence API (JPA), entity beans carry data between application and persistence storage. Exposing internal details or sensitive information through entity beans can lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure @JsonIgnore is used appropriately to avoid sensitive data exposure during serialization or deserialization process. Limit the fields in entity classes, and always sanitize, validate, and authenticate data entering into your entity classes.

Vulnerability: Input Validation and Output Encoding (CWE-79, CWE-20)
Issue: Without sufficient input validation, an attacker can insert malicious data that could compromise the system.
Solution: Consider adding efficient input validation in setter methods to prevent injection attacks. Use proper output encoding or escaping while rendering data.

Vulnerability: Inappropriate implementation of Access Control (CWE-284)
Issue: Data objects could be modified by unauthorized parties if proper access control is not in place.
Solution: Apply best practices for access controls including principle of least privilege (POLP) and proper encapsulation. Use Java's access modifiers to restrict access to object's internal state and restrict functionality.

"""
Scenario 1: Standard Isbn Retrieval

  Details:  
    TestName: standardIsbnRetrieval
    Description: This test is meant to check the general function of the "getIsbn()" method when invoked in a standard situation. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book instance and set up its isbn.
    Act: Call "getIsbn()" method on the book instance. 
    Assert: Verify that the method returns the correct isbn.
  Validation: 
    This check is to ensure that the getIsbn method correctly retrieves the value of isbn for an instance of the book. The expected result is based on the set isbn value of the book.

Scenario 2: Null Isbn Retrieval

  Details:  
    TestName: nullIsbnRetrieval
    Description: This test observes how the "getIsbn()" method behaves when the isbn is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a book instance without setting its isbn.
    Act: Invoke the "getIsbn()" method on the book instance. 
    Assert: Validate that the returned isbn is null.
  Validation: 
    The aim of this test is to validate how the getIsbn method handles null objects, critical to prevent NullPointerExceptions in the implementation.

Scenario 3: Isbn Retrieval for Multiple Instances

  Details:  
    TestName: isbnRetrievalForMultipleInstances
    Description: This test aims to check if the "getIsbn()" method can correctly return isbn for multiple different book instances.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create several book instances with different isbn.
    Act: Make a call to the "getIsbn()" method on each book instance. 
    Assert: Assert that each method call returns the correct isbn for each instance.
  Validation: 
    This test is to verify that the getIsbn method correctly identifies and returns the isbn associated with it's instance of the book object, ensuring that instance data does not get mixed up.
