================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: IDOR vulnerabilities occur when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result, attackers can bypass authorization and directly access resources in the system.
Solution: Limit exposure of internal object references to users and implement access controls checks before allowing access to an internal object.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Information Exposure or CWE-200
Issue: Information Exposure occurs when system information, debug information, or any kind of sensitive information is leaked by the system to an unauthorized party.
Solution: Restrict and control what information is sent to a client's browser. Make sure that the HTTP headers do not expose any sensitive information and system-specific details.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input Data (Cross-Site Scripting) or CWE-79
Issue: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping.
Solution: Ensure that output encoding is applied to all user-generated data before it is returned to the end user to prevent XSS attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test the scenario when the input is a valid author name.

Details:  
  Test Name: validateSetAuthorWithValidInput.
  Description: This test is meant to ensure that the setAuthor method works correctly when a valid author name is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class containing the setAuthor method. Prepare a valid author name.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method using the class object and pass the author name. 
  Assert: Use getter method (if available) to retrieve the value of the author and compare it with the expected result.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setAuthor method correctly saves the author name. It helps to validate the basic functionality of the setAuthor method.

Scenario 2: Test the scenario when the input is null.

Details:  
  Test Name: validateSetAuthorWithNullInput.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setAuthor method handles null input properly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class containing the setAuthor method.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method using the class object and pass null as an input. 
  Assert: Use getter method (if available) to retrieve the author's value and compare it with null.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms whether the setAuthor method can handle null inputs. It checks the null safety of the method.

Scenario 3: Test the scenario when the input is an empty string.

Details:  
  Test Name: validateSetAuthorWithEmptyString.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setAuthor method handles an empty string input appropriately. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class containing the setAuthor method.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method using the class object and pass an empty string as an input. 
  Assert: Use getter method (if available) to retrieve the author's value and compare it with an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies whether the setAuthor method can handle empty string inputs. It checks how the method deals with invalid inputs such as an empty string.

Scenario 4: Test the scenario when the input is a string with special characters.

Details:  
  Test Name: validateSetAuthorWithSpecialCharacters.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setAuthor method handles inputs containing special characters correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class containing the setAuthor method. Prepare a string with special characters.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method using the class object and pass the string with special characters. 
  Assert: Use getter method (if available) to retrieve the author's value and compare it with the input string.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates how the setAuthor method handles inputs containing special characters. It helps test the method's data sanitization ability.
