================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Weak Equality Check
Issue: The equality check used in the equals() method could potentially lead to unexpected results if subclasses of Book are used. Using `getClass()` for comparison purposes may result in failed equality checks if subclasses are compared.
Solution: To prevent issues, consider using `instanceof` instead of `getClass()` for checking if objects are of the same class (or subclass).

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Exception
Issue: The equals() method could throw a NullPointerException if values for author, isbn, or title are not initialized properly. This could lead to unexpected termination of the program.
Solution: Implement null checks at the start of the method and ensure non-null values for fields used in equality checks.

Vulnerability: Improper Access Control
Issue: If author, isbn, and title fields are not properly encapsulated and secured, they may be accessed and modified by other classes, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure all fields are private and can be accessed via getters and setters. Implement access control methods if necessary to ensure data integrity.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the object compared to itself

Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithSelfObject.
Description: The test aims to check the behavior of the equals method when the object is compared to itself.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Book object.
Act: Invoke equals method by passing the same Book object.
Assert: Expect the method to return true.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when an object is compared to itself.

Scenario 2: Test when the object compared is null

Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject.
Description: The test is intended to check the equals method when the object compared is null.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Book object.
Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null.
Assert: Expect the method to return false.
Validation:
This aims to verify that the equals method will return false when the compared object is null.

Scenario 3: Test when the object compared is of different class type

Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassTypeObject.
Description: The test aims to check if the equals method can correctly identify objects of different class types.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Book object and an object of different class type.
Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the different class type object.
Assert: Expect the method to return false.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method will return false when the compared object is of a different class type.

Scenario 4: Test when the object compared has different author

Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentAuthor.
Description: The test is meant to check the equals method when compared objects have different authors.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two Book objects with different authors.
Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one book object to another.
Assert: Expect the method to return false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when the compared objects' authors differ.

Scenario 5: Test when the object compared has different title

Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentTitle.
Description: The test aims to inspect the equals method functionality when the compared Book objects have different titles.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two Book objects with different titles.
Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one book object to another.
Assert: Expect the result to be false.
Validation:
The assertion confirms that the equals method will return false when compared objects' titles differ.

Scenario 6: Test when the object compared has different ISBN

Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentIsbn.
Description: The test aims to check how the equals method behaves when the ISBN of the compared Book objects differs.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two Book objects with different ISBNs.
Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one book object to another.
Assert: Expect the result to be false.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method returns false when the compared objects' ISBNs differ.
