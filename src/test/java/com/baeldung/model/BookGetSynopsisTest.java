================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: Java application can be vulnerable if user-supplied input are not properly validated. It could lead to various vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, etc.
Solution: Perform input validation at every entry point. Use built-in or custom validation code to check data for consistency, correctness, and security.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: If user-supplied input is used to access Java objects directly without proper verification, it can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Apply access control checks or use indirect object references. Avoid exposing direct object references to users.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: Without proper security, application can expose sensitive data. This 'synopsis' getter could lead to unintended data leakage.
Solution: Ensure that any sensitive data is properly secured, including encryption at rest and in transit, and does not get exposed in logs or error messages.

Vulnerability: Missing Method-Level Security (CWE-862)
Issue: In Java applications, without proper method-level access controls, malicious users may gain unauthorized access.
Solution: Depending on the application's security requirements, consider implementing method-level security using Spring Security or some similar framework.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testGetSynopsisReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the `getSynopsis()` method returns the correct synopsis value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a valid Synopsis.
  Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is same as the expected synopsis.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the `getSynopsis()` method correctly retrieves the value of `synopsis`. This is important as it ensures data integrity and correct retrieval of stored values from the entity.

Scenario 2: Test for Empty Synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testForEmptySynopsis
  Description: This test checks if the `getSynopsis()` method correctly handles an empty synopsis.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `synopsis` to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: Assert that an empty string is returned.
Validation: 
  The test verifies that the `getSynopsis()` method can handle empty synopsis strings without errors. This is important as it validates the functionality under unexpected conditions and ensures resilience of the application.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testForNullSynopsis
  Description: This test checks if the `getSynopsis()` method correctly handles a null synopsis.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `synopsis` to null.
  Act: Invoke the `getSynopsis()` method.
  Assert: Assert that null is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the `getSynopsis()` function correctly handles null synopsis values without throwing exceptions. This is important to ensure robustness and improve the fault tolerance of the application.

Scenario 4: Test for Lengthy Synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testForLengthySynopsis
  Description: This test verifies if `getSynopsis()` function handles very long synopsis correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `synopsis` to a very long string.
  Act: Call the method `getSynopsis()`.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is exactly equal to the lengthy synopsis.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that `getSynopsis()` can handle excessively long strings and maintains the integrity of data. This assures the application's consistency in dealing with large amounts of data.

Scenario 5: Test for Special Character in Synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testForSpecialCharacterInSynopsis
  Description: This test verifies if `getSynopsis()` function handles synopsis containing special characters correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `synopsis` to a string containing special characters.
  Act: Invoke the `getSynopsis()` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is exactly equal to the string with special characters.
Validation: 
  The test checks that `getSynopsis()` correctly handles synopsis with special characters. This is important to ensure the correct retrieval and display of data that contain special characters.
