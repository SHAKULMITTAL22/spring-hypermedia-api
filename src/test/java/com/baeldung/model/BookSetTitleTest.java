================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inappropriate Data Exposure
Issue: Exposing all entity attributes without considering the need-to-know basis can lead to data leaks exposing sensitive information.
Solution: Use `@JsonIgnore` or `@JsonView` annotations to control what data should be exposed in the serialization process.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Issue: If user-supplied input is included in SQL queries without sanitization, it may make your application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use JPA's Criteria API or parameterized queries to avoid forming SQL queries by concatenation of strings.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If the user-supplied input incorporated into JSON responses isn't properly escaped, it could trigger Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure Jackson or whichever JSON processing library is used configured to properly escape user-supplied inputs when serializing objects to JSON.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Title Set Test

Details:  
  TestName: shouldSetValidTitle.
  Description: This test will check if the proper title is being set to the object field when a valid string is passed to the setTitle method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new object and a valid String variable title.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the valid String.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion will validate that the title field in the object matches the set title. This is imperative for correct object initialization and further operations.

Scenario 2: Null Title Set Test

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleNullTitle.
  Description: This test will check how the setTitle method handles null inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new object and a null string.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the null String.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion will verify that the title field can accept null values. This is critical to understand how the method handles null inputs. 

Scenario 3: Empty String Title Set Test

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleEmptyStringTitle.
  Description: This test will check how the setTitle method handles empty string inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new object and an empty String.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the empty String.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion will verify that the title field can accept empty String. This is crucial to understand how the method handles input strings with no characters.

Scenario 4: White Space Title Set Test

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleWhiteSpaceTitle.
  Description: This test will check how the setTitle method handles inputs with only whitespaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new object and a String with only white spaces.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the white space String.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field equals to the string of white spaces.
Validation: 
  The assertion will verify that the title field can accept String with only white spaces. This is critical to understand how the method handles such inputs.
  
Scenario 5: Special Characters in Title Set Test

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleSpecialCharactersInTitle.
  Description: This test will check how the setTitle method handles inputs with special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new object and a String containing special characters.
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with the special characters String.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the title field is equal to the string with special characters.
Validation: 
  The assertion will verify that the title field can accept String with special characters. This is important to test the robustness and input validation of the method.
